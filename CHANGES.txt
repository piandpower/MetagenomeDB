v0.2.1b (November 10, 2010)
- now requires Pymongo v1.9 or above
- now attempts to read the connection information from '~/.MetagenomeDB' rather than '[install path]/MetagenomeDB/connection.cfg'
- new tool added: 'mdb-export-sequences'
- new tool added: 'mdb-export-objects'
- tool updated: 'mdb-import-BLAST-alignments', which can now import alignments against sequences that are not in the database (e.g., NR) and filter alignments according to their E-value and/or percentage of identity
- a bug in the installation process has been fixed; README.rst has been updated accordingly

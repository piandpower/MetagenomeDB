MetagenomeDB
============

**MetagenomeDB** is a Python_-powered toolkit designed to easily store, retrieve and annotate genomic and metagenomic sequences. It is especially useful when dealing with large amount of sequences (e.g., reads and contigs resulting from several runs of sequencing and assembly), and offers a clean, programmatic interface to manage and query this information.

This page contains everything you need to know to use **MetagenomeDB**.

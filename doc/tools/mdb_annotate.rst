Annotating objects: mdb-annotate (in construction)
==================================================

* Syntax of the CSV and JSON files used by mdb-annotate:
	- differences between replacing, appending and removing properties
	- fact that JSON only supports replacing
	- dot notation (and the fact dots can't be used in a property name, even with quotes)
	- value types
	- protecting value and/or key with quotes

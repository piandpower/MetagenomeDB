Tutorial (INCOMPLETE)
=====================

This tutorial is intended as an introduction to working with **MetagenomeDB**.

Before we start, make sure that you have the MetagenomeDB toolkit installed (see :doc:`documentation <installation>`). In the Python shell, the following should run without raising an exception::

   >>> import MetagenomeDB

For practical purpose, in all examples of this tutorial we will use an alias for the library, *mdb*::

   >>> import MetagenomeDB as mdb

This tutorial also assumes that a MongoDB server is running and the connection information (server host, port, name of the database, etc.) are stored in the file ``~/.MetagenomeDB``. Assuming you have `downloaded and installed <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Getting+Started>`_ MongoDB, you can start it like so::

   $ mongod
